  summary: Ab-initio Interface Materials Simulation Project for Grain Boundaries (AIMSGB)
  description: |
    aimsgb, an efficient and open-source Python library for generating
    atomic coordinates in periodic grain boundary models. It is designed
    to construct various grain boundary structures from cubic and
    non-cubic initial configurations. A convenient command line tool has
    also been provided to enable easy and fast construction of tilt and 
    twist boundaries by assigining the degree of fit (Σ), rotation axis,
    grain boundary plane and initial crystal structure. aimsgb is expected
    to greatly accelerate the theoretical investigation of grain boundary
    properties and facilitate the experimental analysis of grain boundary
    structures as well.
